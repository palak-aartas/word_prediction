"University of London Accommodation Services United Kingdom To Whom It May Concern, Re: Medical Recommendation for Student Housing – Manya Katyal I am writing to provide my professional opinion regarding the accommodation requirements of my patient, Ms. Sara Motwani, who is currently under my care for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). Firstly, I would like to confirm that Ms. Sara Motwani has been under my care for the aforementioned medical conditions. She has shown a commendable commitment to managing her health and has taken proactive steps to ensure the best possible outcomes. (a) Recommendation for Readmission on Medical Grounds: I unequivocally recommend readmission to the University of London halls of residence on medical grounds for Ms. Sara Motwani. Her medical conditions, IBS and PCOS, both require specific considerations for optimal management. The provision of catered accommodation with an en-suite room would significantly aid in maintaining her health and well-being. (b) How Living on Campus Aids in Medical Condition Management: Living on campus, specifically within the University's halls of residence, would greatly assist in the management of Ms. Motwani's medical conditions: IBS Management: IBS necessitates a strict dietary regimen to alleviate symptoms. Access to catered accommodation would ensure that Ms. Motwani receives meals that are carefully tailored to her dietary needs, reducing the risk of symptom exacerbation. Furthermore, proximity to catering facilities would enhance her convenience in adhering to this essential dietary plan. PCOS and Mental Well-being: PCOS has a direct correlation with mental wellness, including anxiety-related concerns. Ms. Motwani has attested that her three-year residency within the Garden Halls, where she has resided since 2020, has provided her with a sense of familiarity, security, and emotional stability. This environment has been instrumental in reducing her anxiety levels and has positively contributed to her overall well-being. Benefit of Familiar Surroundings: I must emphasize that familiar surroundings have played a pivotal role in Ms. Motwani's stress reduction and overall well-being. Given her extended stay in the Garden Halls, maintaining this continuity by allocating her to the same halls would be highly advantageous for her mental health and academic success. (c) Specific Additional Measures Recommended: In light of Ms. Motwani's medical conditions and the unique circumstances she faces, I recommend the following additional measures: Dr. Ankur Sharma, MBBS 18A Ring Road, Lajpat Nagar IV New Delhi – 110024 Contact: 98111 60068 Catered Accommodation: Providing Ms. Motwani with catered accommodation is crucial. It ensures that her dietary needs are consistently met, reducing the risk of digestive discomfort associated with IBS. En-Suite Room: An en-suite room is highly recommended to afford Ms. Motwani privacy and convenience. This added comfort will contribute positively to her overall well-being, especially considering her medical conditions. I am available for any further inquiries or discussions regarding Ms. Motwani's medical conditions and accommodation requirements. Please do not hesitate to reach out",General Surgery

Firstly, I would like to confirm that Ms. Manya Katyal has been under my care for the aforementioned medical conditions. (a) Recommendation for university accommodation on medical grounds : I unequivocally recommend admission to the Green Park house university accommodation on medical grounds for Ms. Manya Katyal. Her medical conditions require specific considerations for optimal management. The provision of catered accommodation would significantly aid in maintaining her health and well-being. (b) How living in a university accommodation aids in medical condition management : Living in a university accommodation specifically within the city, would greatly assist in the management of Ms. Manya Katyal’s medical conditions: Dietary Management : She requires the ability to prepare her own meals to ensure they align with the dietary needs and prevent symptom exacerbation. Therefore, a studio with a kitchen would be needed, to control the ingredients and cooking methods. Additionally, proximity to a market or grocery store is essential. Being able to prepare meals as needed will minimize risks associated with eating out and ensure to avoid triggers. ⁠Mental Well Being : Being around familiar people have played a pivotal role in Ms. Katyal’s stress reduction and overall well-being. Maintaining continuity by allocating her Green Park accommodation would be highly advantageous for her mental health and academic stress since she has friends who are staying there as well.

"Chief Complaints The patient presents with chronic disc pain primarily affecting the L1 and L2 discs, which has resulted in recurring pain radiating to the neck and right leg. The patient has previously sought various treatments, including Ayurvedic medicine and exercise regimens from an QI spine clinic. The patient is looking for a permanent solution to the pain without opting for surgical intervention. Investigation Orders No specific investigations are ordered at this time as the focus is on managing the existing symptoms and understanding the chronic nature of the condition. Assessment (Diagnosis) The patient is diagnosed with chronic disc pain involving the L1 and L2 discs, associated with episodes of referred pain in the neck and right leg. The condition appears to be chronic, and while management strategies can be implemented, a complete resolution of the disc condition cannot be assured. Prescription To manage the chronic disc pain effectively, I recommend the following: Medication: ○ NSAIDs (e.g., Ibuprofen 400 mg): Take 1 tablet every 8 hours as needed for pain relief. ○ Muscle Relaxants (e.g., Tizanidine 2 mg): Take 1 tablet at bedtime for muscle spasms. ○ Topical Analgesic (e.g., Diclofenac Gel): Apply to the affected areas 3 times daily as needed. Physical Therapy: ○ Continue with prescribed exercises from the IQ clinic, focusing on strengthening and flexibility. Lifestyle Modifications: ○ Incorporate daily gentle stretching and low-impact aerobic activities, such as walking or swimming. Follow-Up: ○ Regular follow-up appointments will be necessary to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed. Additional Notes While the treatment plan aims to alleviate pain and improve functionality, it is important for the patient to understand the chronic nature of the condition and remain engaged in the management process.",Physiotherapy
